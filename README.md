# Hey, I'm Sudi 👋

AI Product Manager building production AI systems with focus on agentic workflows and cost-efficient reasoning.

## What I'm Building

I'm focused on shipping AI products that solve real problems - not just demos. Currently exploring:
- Multi-agent orchestration and coordination
- Cost vs latency trade-offs in production LLM systems
- Agentic workflows with robust failure handling

## Featured Work

🚧 Building my portfolio - first project launching soon

## How I Work

**Tools:** Claude for ideation & specs → Cursor for development → GitHub for shipping

**Philosophy:** Ship fast, measure everything, learn from what breaks
